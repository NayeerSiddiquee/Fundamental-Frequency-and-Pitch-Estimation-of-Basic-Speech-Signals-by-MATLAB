# Fundamental-Frequency-and-Pitch-Estimation-of-Basic-Speech-Signals-by-MATLAB
This project includes both frequency and time domain analysis.
Frequency domain analysis:
1) Fast fourier transform (fundamental frequency)
2) Periodogram (pitch)
3) Welch's periodogram (pitch)

Time domain analysis:
1) Autocorrelation (fundamental frequency)
2) Cepstrum (fundamental frequency)
